Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; and a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.[41] In people without prior ear, nose, or throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19 and is reported in as many as 88% of symptomatic cases.[42][43][44]\n","\n","Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) that require hospitalization, and 5% of patients develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) requiring ICU admission.[45][needs update]\n","\n","\n","Proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection by age. About 44% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic throughout the infection.[46]\n","At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[46][47][48] These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can still spread the disease.[48][49][50][51] Other infected people will develop symptoms later (called \"pre-symptomatic\") or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.[51]\n","\n","As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. The median delay for COVID-19 is four to five days[52] possibly being infectious on 1-4 of those days.[53] Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.[52][54]\n","\n","Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. However, some people continue to experience a range of effects, such as fatigue, for months, even after recovery.[55] This is the result of a condition called long COVID, which can be described as a range of persistent symptoms that continue for weeks or months at a time.[56] Long-term damage to organs has also been observed after the onset of COVID-19. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the potential long-term effects of the disease.[57]\n","\n","The Omicron variant became dominant in the U.S. in December 2021. Symptoms with the Omicron variant are less severe than they are with other variants.[58]\n","Complications\n","\n","Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm and complications\n","Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.[59][60][61][62] Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation), heart inflammation, and thrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism.[63][64][65][66][67][68] Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID‑19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury.[69][70]\n","\n","Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes loss of motor functions).[71][72] Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.[73][74] In very rare cases, acute encephalopathy can occur, and it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with COVID‑19 and have an altered mental status.[75]\n","\n","According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID‑19.[76] This is because pregnant women with COVID‑19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction.[76]\n","\n","Fungal infections such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, cryptococcosis and mucormycosis have been recorded in patients recovering from COVID‑19.[77][78]\n","\n","Cause\n","COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2).[79]\n","\n","Transmission\n","Main article: Transmission of COVID-19\n","\n","Transmission of COVID‑19\n","COVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus. Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing.[80][81][82][83] Transmission is more likely the closer people are. However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.[80][84]\n","\n","The transmission of the virus is carried out through virus-laden fluid particles, or droplets, which are created in the respiratory tract, and they are expelled by the mouth and the nose. There are three types of transmission: “droplet” and “contact”, which are associated with large droplets, and “airborne”, which is associated with small droplets.[85] If the droplets are above a certain critical size, they settle faster than they evaporate, and therefore they contaminate surfaces surrounding them.[85] Droplets that are below a certain critical size, evaporate faster than they settle; due to that fact, they form nuclei that remain airborne for a long period of time over extensive distances.[85]\n","\n","Infectivity can begin four to five days before the onset of symptoms.[86] Infected people can spread the disease even if they are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic.[87] Most commonly, the peak viral load in upper respiratory tract samples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms begin.[87] Current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness of up to ten days following symptom onset for people with mild to moderate COVID-19, and up to 20 days for persons with severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised people.[88][87]\n","\n","Infectious particles range in size from aerosols that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to larger droplets that remain airborne briefly or fall to the ground.[89][90][91][92] Additionally, COVID-19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses are transmitted.[92][93] The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, but can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect.[91] Aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity, which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close,[91][92][93] but airborne transmission can occur at longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated;[91] in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.[91][94]\n","Virology\n","Main article: SARS-CoV-2\n","\n","Illustration of SARSr-CoV virion\n","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[95] All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature,[96] particularly in Rhinolophus sinicus aka Chinese horseshoe bats.[97]\n","\n","Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap which bursts its protective bubble.[98] Hospital disinfectants, alcohols, heat, povidone-iodine, and ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation are also effective disinfection methods for surfaces.[99]\n","\n","SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[100] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[101][102][103] The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV.[104]\n","\n","SARS-CoV-2 variants\n","Main article: Variants of SARS-CoV-2\n","The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages.[105][106] The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango. The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of the Greek alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, giving the justification that they \"will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences.\"[107] Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).[108] The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage.[106][109]\n","\n","Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged throughout 2020.[110][111] Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark.[112] After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of 1 February 2021.[113]\n","\n","As of December 2021, there are five dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations: the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and Kent, the Beta variant (B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa variant), the Gamma variant (P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant), the Delta variant (B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant),[114] and the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as of 7 December.[115][116]\n","\n","On December 19, 2023, the WHO declared that another distinctive variant, JN.1, had emerged as a \"variant of interest.\" Though the WHO expects an increase in cases globally, particularly for countries entering winter, the current overall global health risk (as of December 21, 2023) remains low.[117][118]\n","\n","Pathophysiology\n","\n","COVID‑19 pathogenesis\n","The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. COVID‑19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).[119] The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs.[120] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell.[121]\n","\n","Respiratory tract\n","Following viral entry, COVID‑19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways.[122]\n","\n","Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.[123]\n","\n","Nervous system\n","One common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons.[124] The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications.[125] It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the central nervous system (CNS) of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed.[126] While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[127][128][129] The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood–brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell.[126]\n","\n","\n","Tropism and multiple organ injuries in SARS-CoV-2 infection\n","Research conducted when Alpha was the dominant variant has suggested COVID-19 may cause brain damage.[130] Later research showed that all variants studied (including Omicron) killed brain cells, but the exact cells killed varied by variant.[131] It is unknown if such damage is temporary or permanent.[132][133] Observed individuals infected with COVID-19 (most with mild cases) experienced an additional 0.2% to 2% of brain tissue lost in regions of the brain connected to the sense of smell compared with uninfected individuals, and the overall effect on the brain was equivalent on average to at least one extra year of normal ageing; infected individuals also scored lower on several cognitive tests. All effects were more pronounced among older ages.[134]\n","\n","Gastrointestinal tract\n","The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[135] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[136]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["txt\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":191},"id":"rNnzAuUCy0Zn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706507985757,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":589,"user":{"displayName":"G Prashanth","userId":"03107271224293963233"}},"outputId":"5ad69746-c8d9-4b32-c248-16730ad92dec"},"execution_count":40,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\nFor the pandemic caused by the said disease, see COVID-19 pandemic.

Symptoms with the Omicron variant are less severe than they are with other variants.[58]\\nComplications\\n\\nMechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm and complications\\nComplications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.[59][60][61][62] Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation), heart inflammation, and thrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism.[63][64][65][66][67][68] Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID‑19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury.[69][70]\\n\\nNeurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes loss of motor functions).[71][72] Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.[73][74] In very rare cases, acute encephalopathy can occur, and it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with COVID‑19 and have an altered mental status.[75]\\n\\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID‑19.[76] This is because pregnant women with COVID‑19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction.[76]\\n\\nFungal infections such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, cryptococcosis and mucormycosis have been recorded in patients recovering from COVID‑19.[77][78]\\n\\nCause\\nCOVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as \\'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2\\' (SARS-CoV-2).[79]\\n\\nTransmission\\nMain article: Transmission of COVID-19\\n\\nTransmission of COVID‑19\\nCOVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus. Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing.[80][81][82][83] Transmission is more likely the closer people are. However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.[80][84]\\n\\nThe transmission of the virus is carried out through virus-laden fluid particles, or droplets, which are created in the respiratory tract, and they are expelled by the mouth and the nose. There are three types of transmission: “droplet” and “contact”, which are associated with large droplets, and “airborne”, which is associated with small droplets.[85] If the droplets are above a certain critical size, they settle faster than they evaporate, and therefore they contaminate surfaces surrounding them.[85] Droplets that are below a certain critical size, evaporate faster than they settle; due to that fact, they form nuclei that remain airborne for a long period of time over extensive distances.[85]\\n\\nInfectivity can begin four to five days before the onset of symptoms.[86] Infected people can spread the disease even if they are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic.[87] Most commonly, the peak viral load in upper respiratory tract samples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms begin.[87] Current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness of up to ten days following symptom onset for people with mild to moderate COVID-19, and up to 20 days for persons with severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised people.[88][87]\\n\\nInfectious particles range in size from aerosols that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to larger droplets that remain airborne briefly or fall to the ground.[89][90][91][92] Additionally, COVID-19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses are transmitted.[92][93] The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, but can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect.[91] Aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity, which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close,[91][92][93] but airborne transmission can occur at longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated;[91] in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.[91][94]\\nVirology\\nMain article: SARS-CoV-2\\n\\nIllustration of SARSr-CoV virion\\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[95] All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature,[96] particularly in Rhinolophus sinicus aka Chinese horseshoe bats.[97]\\n\\nOutside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap which bursts its protective bubble.[98] Hospital disinfectants, alcohols, heat, povidone-iodine, and ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation are also effective disinfection methods for surfaces.[99]\\n\\nSARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[100] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[101][102][103] The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV.[104]\\n\\nSARS-CoV-2 variants\\nMain article: Variants of SARS-CoV-2\\nThe many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages.[105][106] The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango. The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of the Greek alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, giving the justification that they \"will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences.\"[107] Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).[108] The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage.[106][109]\\n\\nSeveral notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged throughout 2020.[110][111] Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark.[112] After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of 1 February 2021.[113]\\n\\nAs of December 2021, there are five dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations: the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and Kent, the Beta variant (B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa variant), the Gamma variant (P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant), the Delta variant (B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant),[114] and the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as of 7 December.[115][116]\\n\\nOn December 19, 2023, the WHO declared that another distinctive variant, JN.1, had emerged as a \"variant of interest.\" Though the WHO expects an increase in cases globally, particularly for countries entering winter, the current overall global health risk (as of December 21, 2023) remains low.[117][118]\\n\\nPathophysiology\\n\\nCOVID‑19 pathogenesis\\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. COVID‑19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).[119] The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs.[120] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell.[121]\\n\\nRespiratory tract\\nFollowing viral entry, COVID‑19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways.[122]\\n\\nAutopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.[123]\\n\\nNervous system\\nOne common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons.[124] The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications.[125] It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the central nervous system (CNS) of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed.[126] While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[127][128][129] The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood–brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell.[126]\\n\\n\\nTropism and multiple organ injuries in SARS-CoV-2 infection\\nResearch conducted when Alpha was the dominant variant has suggested COVID-19 may cause brain damage.[130] Later research showed that all variants studied (including Omicron) killed brain cells, but the exact cells killed varied by variant.[131] It is unknown if such damage is temporary or permanent.[132][133] Observed individuals infected with COVID-19 (most with mild cases) experienced an additional 0.2% to 2% of brain tissue lost in regions of the brain connected to the sense of smell compared with uninfected individuals, and the overall effect on the brain was equivalent on average to at least one extra year of normal ageing; infected individuals also scored lower on several cognitive tests. All effects were more pronounced among older ages.[134]\\n\\nGastrointestinal tract\\nThe virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[135] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[136]'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":40}]}]}
